## Long Bio but funny... I guess

My journey into the world of programming began quite a long time ago, it's hard for some to believe, but what got me on the path was boredom. It somehow happened that at the age of 11 I found the book "HTML & CSS for Dummies", well, that's how it went :)

I love TypeScript very much, before I face it I was sure that I would never like it or use, but one day I just fell in love with it, now I use it on a daily basis. If there is a possibility to use it my project - **I will ^_^**.

I got acquainted with React even earlier and TypeScript was a game changer for how I develop applications on React, I think it's probably the best bunch I've worked with and have been working with for some more years. One of things I really like to do in react is creating my own components, more for fun, so I learn how some existing components work, for example `DateRangePicker` or `CheckTreePicker`. By this time, I already have a large number of components and [my own template](https://github.com/FrameMuse/react-template).

I constantly learning and reading foreign magazines and articles, sometime I had to read an article about
mathematics in order to figure out the difficult task, this was "rotation matrix" - _Oh heaven, this was a hell_.

As for UI interfaces, I have been working with them for a long time, about 5 years, sometimes I even “scold” designers for inaccuracies: in the selection of colors, in the wrong centering, or in principle when the solution is inconvenient, not practical and difficult to implement. I blame on them: why you can't just do your job - this is so much pain to work with incompetent designers as they have a lot of responsibility which they underestimate.

I am constantly developing and striving for new heights, I learn very quickly, not only because of "some" experience in this area, but also because of interests and hobbies in different, unrelated areas.
I am fond of learning languages and programming languages. I try to create and develop my
own projects. I try to approach the task responsibly, although I sometimes get lazy, bored and can get exhausted (I need to get enough rest), I once got breakdown and burnout - disgusting feeling, but gives life experience.
My hobbies are skateboarding, playing musical instruments (I study in a musical conservatory as a percussionist), PC games, and I also like listening to
music (any kind), I try to do physical exercises, several years ago I had been engaged in karate.

Trying myself in new places, learning Unity, trying to create a couple of games. During the learning process I loved C#.
I follow and participate (a little though) in the life of ECMA - I look through tc39 proposals and comment on them, put forward my suggestions on proposals.

I also studied at Czeck language school for 9 months and some months at Japanese.

_Thank you for reading_, in the case if you really read it.
